# customization

### Scripts and config files to customize dev enviroments etc. 

Currently contains some customizations for ´.gitconfig´ and ´.bash_profile´. The filenaes have been prepended with ´REMOVE_THIS´ to avoid them being hidden in directory listings. 

You may use these files as they are or copy selected sections and add them to your own existing config files.
